NOTE: This example involves applying a calibration and therefore must be run with a real PicoVNA instrument.
This example will not work with the simulated demonstration device.

    #     MMEMory:STORe:TRACe:OPTion:ONEPORTPARAMETER -- if exporting 1-port data, which port to export (S11 or S22)?
    #     MMEMory:STORe:TRACe:OPTion:TABS -- use tabs or spaces?

    # Navigate to the directory where we want to write the output
