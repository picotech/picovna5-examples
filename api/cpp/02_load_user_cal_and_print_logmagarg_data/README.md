Loads a user calibration and sets up a frequency sweep with the same parameters as those detected from the loaded calibration.
Runs a sweep (using asynchronous mode), with measurement points uniformly spaced in frequency, and prints the results.
The measurements are printed in LogMag/Phase format.

NOTE: This example involves applying a calibration and therefore must be run with a real PicoVNA instrument. This example will not work with the simulated demonstration device.
